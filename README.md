- **Documentation** <https://LishuaiJing3.github.io/LLM-fine-tuning/>

## Getting started with your project

First, create a repository on GitHub with the same name as this project, and then run the following commands:

``` bash
git init -b main
git add .
git commit -m "init commit"
git remote add origin git@github.com:LishuaiJing3/LLM-fine-tuning.git
git push -u origin main
```

Finally, install the environment and the pre-commit hooks with 

```bash
make install
```

You are now ready to start development on your project! The CI/CD
pipeline will be triggered when you open a pull request, merge to main,
or when you create a new release.
